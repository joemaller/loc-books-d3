# Building a D3 timeline visualization from LOC data

The Library of Congress published this list of [Books that Shaped America][bsa]. I thought it would be a fun project to try and visualize it. 

First, I'm normalizing the data, specifically retrieving date-of-birth and date-of-death data from Wikipedia's Wikidata API.
